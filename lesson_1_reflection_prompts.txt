How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Concentrating on the differences makes it easy to spot errors

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It gives me the info who did what and when, I makes it possible to go back to
    older versions easily if the new changes didn't work out well for me.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: I decide when to commit, commits will be limited (not huge number)
    Cons: I may forget, the repo can be distroyed

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    As a programmer it's common that certain feature spans multiple files so it's
    important to have this feature in the version control system used

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use git log to list all teh commits and git diff to compare any 2 commits to
    get idea of the changes that took place

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because it's possible to make a massive change and test is if not working
    as planned it can be reverted easily
